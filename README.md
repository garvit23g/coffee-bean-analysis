# coffee-bean-analysis
Characterizing the quality of a coffee bean given various testing and tasting parameters. 

The specialty coffee industry focuses on the most exciting and tasty coffees in the world. The importers and wholesalers who transact in this market can command a premium price because of the high quality associated with high grade, specialty coffee beans. However, in order to actually capture the potential premium embedded in the price, the wholesaler or importer must successfully manage the risk of incorrectly identifying the quality of the beans and, as a consequence, minimize the risk of overpaying for what it purchases. This report will develop and discuss a framework that will help mitigate pricing risk and, consequently, help reduce overall revenue volatility.

This project deals with figuring out different classification models that would help reduce the risk adn cost of the Coffee wholesaler.
First, the data was cleaned and normalized, then an EDA was done to better understand the distribution of the data.

The following classification models have been idenitified in this project:  
  1. Decision Tree 
  2. Random Forest 
  3. KNN 
  4. XGBoost
